GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source 
code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool,
GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and
several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.[2]
